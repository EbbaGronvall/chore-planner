# Chore Planner

My vision with this project was to create a webpage for families to plan their everyday life. I overscoped and got caught up in the API and started on the frontend to late in the process. I then got hit with two migraine attacks within a week so all the work I needed to do could not be done. This project is an obvious fail so don't even waste your time going through it.
